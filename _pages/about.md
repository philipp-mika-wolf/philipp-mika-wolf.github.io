I am a physicist at Uppsala University where I am part of the [Materials Physics Division](https://www.uu.se/en/department/physics-and-astronomy/research/materials-physics). Between September 2020 and December 2024 I completed my PhD studies in the same group where my main supervisor was Prof. Daniel Primetzhofer and my co-supervisors were Prof. Zhen Zhang, Dr. Tuan T. Tran, and Dr. Eduardo Pitthan. My dissertation is accesible [here](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-540635).

Here you can check my [full CV](https://philipp-mika-wolf.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).

My studies focus on the growth and modification of transition metal compounds and their *in-situ* analysis using Time-of-Flight Low Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-LEIS) as well as complementary ion beam techniques. Additionally I study the interaction of slow light ions with matter to improve our understanding of properties like electronic stopping and the interatomic potential.
