I am a physicist and postdoctoral researcher at Uppsala University in the [Solid-State Electronics Division](https://www.uu.se/en/department/electrical-engineering/research/solid-state-electronics) of the Department of Electrical Engineering. Previously, I was part of the [Materials Physics Division](https://www.uu.se/en/department/physics-and-astronomy/research/materials-physics), where I completed my PhD studies under the supervision of Daniel Primetzhofer, with Zhen Zhang, Tuan T. Tran, and Eduardo Pitthan as co-supervisors. My dissertation is accessible [here](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-540635), and you can check my full CV [here](https://philipp-mika-wolf.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).

My research interests focus on the growth and modification of thin films using physical vapor deposition and a wide range of analytical techniques, including various ion beam analysis methods with a particular emphasis on low-energy ions. I study transition metal compounds for applications in thin film electronics and mechanical systems, as well as photochromic and thermochromic coatings.
