I am a PhD student at Uppsala University where I am part of the ion physics group. Before I started my PhD studies in the fall of 2020, I received a M.Sc. from Uppsala University and a B.Sc. from the Karlsruher Institute of Technology.

# Research Interests

My studies focus on the growth and modification of transition metal compounds and their in-situ analysis using Time-of-Flight Low Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-LEIS) as well as complementary ion beam techniques.
