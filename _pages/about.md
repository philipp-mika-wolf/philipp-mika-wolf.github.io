I am a PhD student at Uppsala University where I am part of the [ion physics group](https://www.physics.uu.se/research/applied-nuclear-physics/groups/ion-physics/). Before I started my PhD studies in the fall of 2020, I studied physics at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology and at Uppsala University. My main PhD supervisor is Prof. Daniel Primetzhofer with the co-supervisors being Prof. Zhen Zhang, Tuan T. Tran, and Eduardo Pitthan. Here you can check my [full CV](https://philipp-mika-wolf.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).

# Research Interests

My studies focus on the growth and modification of transition metal compounds and their in-situ analysis using Time-of-Flight Low Energy Ion Scattering (ToF-LEIS) as well as complementary ion beam techniques.

ToF-LEIS, with typical ion energies of 0.5 to 10 keV is capable of detecting both scattered ions and neutrals, which enables us to study the composition and the structure of ultra-thin films with a mono-layer resolution.

One example of my research is our [study of ultra-thin nickel silicide films](https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202106093) (3.6 nm deposited Ni). Due to its low resistivity nickel silicide is a compound often used in thin film electronics for the formation of contact layers. By combining several ex-situ and in-situ experiments we were able to show that the phase transition for ultra-thin films deviates from the phase transition observed in thick films. While the phase transition in thick films is given by Ni-on-Si to orthorhombic Ni<sub>2</sub>Si to orthorhombic NiSi and finally to cubic NiSi<sub>2</sub>, our results show that for ultra-thin films formed on Si(100) substrates the NiSi phase is missing and a direct transition from Ni<sub>2</sub>Si to NiSi<sub>2</sub> takes place.
